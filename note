1. We are currently using OHLC, but not volume, find a value to scale it.
2. what are we prediciting? OHLC as well?
3. We are using the adjusted OHLC value.
4. check if the gradient is vanishing or exploding
5. future improvemnet
6. output the model activation function for interpreability =
7. For this model, the normalization is kinda problematic, I think why the train_loss_epoch is so high for 2000-2005 but 
    become normal (means trainloss < testloss) in 2005-2010 is because 2000-2005, the price flucuate quite a long and 
    sclaing has some problem.


Semester two experiment log:
1. Using higher inference window size, the performance is better.
2. In nn.ModuleList, WaveKANLayer is good in capturing drastic changes, TaylorKANLayer is good in capturing smooth changes, 
    combining them together achieve the best result, 
    TaylorKANLayer's order = 3 achieve the best result.
3. Should we do validation set in the real time inference? Since we want to predict data ASAP?
4. Seems like shorter inference window size, the performance is better.
5. revin_affine = True or Flase give different result , it depends on period. 
6. There are many rooms to improve the trading strategy since we get same loss day but 
    very different profit. So we can see that in some day we should do nothing.

TODO (18/02/2025)
1. Add learnable confidence estimation to the model in DenseRMoK.py
2. Add more trading strategy to the ltsf_runner.py, create a file for trading strategy.

TODO (24/02/2025)
1. Try this paper:Improving the prediction of asset returns with machine learning by using a
custom loss function.
2. Try Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)

Note (24/02/2025)
1. Using variance between model prediction to estimate the confidence does not work well.
